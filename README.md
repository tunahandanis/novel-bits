## Inspiration

Companies such as Webnovel and Royal Road provided an environment for authors to share their work and gain some support while providing its users access to many good novels. However, they are highly centralized; and in many cases, provides unfair circumstances for its authors.

## What it does

NovelBits is a decentralized platform that lets authors publish their novels, have their readers see their work and support them if they wish to.

## How we built it

The web application is built with **Next.js**, smart contracts written with **Solidity** and **HardHat**, backend with **Node.js**, and version control with **Git**.

## Challenges we ran into

As a developer very new to the blockchain development, I struggled a lot with all the configurations.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

I'm very inexperienced in the blockchain development, it was a tough process; but I managed to build most of what I wanted, for which I'm content.

## What we learned

A lot of stuff on blockchain development!

## What's next for NovelBits
- Likes and comments for the novels
- Leaderboard
- Possibly having authors mint their book and chapter NFTs
- More flexible configurations, such as free chapter count
- Option to buy a specific amount of chapters instead of the whole book for much smaller price
